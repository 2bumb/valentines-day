<p>Upon hearing my friend's dilemma about asking out his potential significant other, I was inspired to create something unique for Valentine's Day: Anime Gag Note. I was informed of his crush's love for humor and passion for anime, so I decided to infuse the note with a special surprise. While aiming for the note to be cute and friendly, I wanted it to stand out and be unforgettable. With my friend's approval, I crafted the note, hoping to create a memorable moment for both of them.</p>

<p>Button: I created two reactive buttons that respond when the user hovers over them. If the user hovers over the 'no' button, the 'no-btn' will immediately move downwards, out of the user's view.

If the user clicks on 'yes', the button will react by displaying Kakashi (an anime character) dancing, transitioning to the audio and the 'surprise', which will reset 

Event Handling: Used addEventListener() creating a sequence of events when the user clicks "yes".

DOM Manipulation: I set the background image of the webpage by adjusting the background-image property of the document.body.style, which allowed me to display a GIF as the background during the event

<p>Implmeneted a time out</p>

<p>Button:If the button is hovered, the button class no-btn start to go down. In the future I will create a script where the no-btn will only jump around the users screen rather than going off the screen

Sequence: when the "yes" button is clicked there is a delay for the audio even if I adjust the time.
