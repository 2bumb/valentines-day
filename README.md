<p>Upon hearing my friend's dilemma about asking out his potential significant other, I was inspired to create something unique for Valentine's Day: Anime Gag Note.I was inform his crush's love for humor and passion for anime, I decided to infuse the note with a special surprise. While aiming for the note to be cute and friendly, I wanted it to stand out and be unforgettable. With my friend's approval, I crafted the note, hoping to create a memorable moment for both of them.

<h1>Components used:</h1>
<p>Button:I created two reactive. If the user hovers on "no" the "no-btn" will immediately go down out of the users view</p>

<h1>What I learn:</h1>
<p></p>

<h1>What I can improve: </h1>

<p>Button:If the button is hovered, the button class no-btn start to go down. In the future I will create a script where the no-btn will only jump around the users screen rather than going off the screen</p>
