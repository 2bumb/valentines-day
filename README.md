<h1>Valentines Day Gag Note </h1>
<br>
<p>Creating a Valentine's Day Gag Note was inspired by my friend and anime. As the  special occasion approach he needed assistance to ask out his potential significant other, so I came up with the great idea to create a, "Valentine's Day Gag Note".  


In the beginning I wanted to make the Valentine's Day Note to be cute and friendly which is expected when asking a significant other out. To combat this dilemma I incorporate a "special surprise" which was approved by my friend as his potential significant other has a passion for anime and likes to joke around

 will be worth remebering.
